            My grandpa was a Buddhist monk before he became a policeman 
            during the British rule in Burma (Myanmar).
            He took robes willingly when he was a little boy and 
            later became a well-educated Buddhist monk in Sri Lanka. 
            As a young monk, he went on a missionary trip to Burma.
            However, he decided to end his monastic life for some reason .

            During the World War II, he was in Burma as a policeman 
            serving for the British empire. His loyalty and the strong 
            commitment to keeping law and order made him popular in his 
            community and among his superiors. Grandpa had told my mom 
            that there were articles about him in newspapers.

            One day, he was in a social gathering with fellow officers
            in a hotel, chilling with friends around a round-table.
            Those days, Japanese emperor was fiercely expanding 
            his territory in Asia. Burmese native army who tried to overturn
            British rule was an ally of the Japanese empire. There might be 
            concerns among officers on growing Japanese power and native militants. 
            When my grandpa was about to have the dinner, he had become uncomfortable 
            with some whispering in his ears. He felt that someone tried to stop him 
            having the dinner. But, he ignored that feeling and pulled his chair 
            towards the table to have dinner. However, he could not take a single bite; 
            a strong force started to pull his chair back and it wanted him to leave 
            the table. The force had made him so uncomfortable that he decided to stand, 
            but did not leave the room since leaving the table in the middle of a dinner 
            was not a "gentleman thing". But the force did not stop. It started pushing 
            him out of the hotel. Unable to cope with the intense feeling and forcing, 
            he stepped out the hotel and kept walking away. When he was far away from 
            the hotel, he heard the sound of airplanes coming toward the hotel from distance. 
            Suspecting that they might be Japanese, grandpa had turned back to alarm his friends. 
            But he was too late. Japanese bombs smashed the hotel to the ground in next few minute. 
            He had a wound from shrapnel.

            Grandpa believed the force that saved him was his father who was a devoted Buddhist.
            My great grandpa was the chief of a town called Galigamuwa in Sri Lanka. 
            He dug out a cave in a rock and turned it into a shrine room in the Buddhist temple 
            near my ancestral home in Galigamuwa. There is a  fresco of him in this shrine room. 
            Grandpa believed his father had become a "deva" (like angels in Christianity) after 
            his death and protected him from the Japanese bomb.
